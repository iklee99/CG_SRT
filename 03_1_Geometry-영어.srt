1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,820
We will study at this time about vectors and geometry

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:08,060
in mathematical graphics theory.

3
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:11,060
Many things are very basic,

4
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:15,690
and these are things that you already knew.

5
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:21,320
Even so, let's study together in the sense of reviewing.

6
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,980
The right-handed coordinate system

7
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:28,030
is the coordinate system we typically use in math class.

8
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:31,090
The OpenGL APIs we'll be using in this course

9
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:36,030
also use the right-handed coordinate system.

10
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:42,250
In CG, the y-axis is typically oriented overhead.

11
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:47,390
The +z axis is the direction out from the screen.

12
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:52,740
Make the thumb, index, and middle fingers of your right hand,

13
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:55,300
perpendicular to each other, The fingers point in the direction of

14
00:00:55,300 --> 00:01:02,390
the x, y, and z axes of the r-h coord. system, in that order.

15
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:04,690
In the left-handed coord. system,

16
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:07,900
z-axis is pointing to the inside of the screen.

17
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:11,670
In CG, we use this left-handed coordinate system

18
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:13,470
in the camera coordinate system,

19
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:16,470
which we'll learn about in the viewing transformation.

20
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:20,160
We will study this later.

21
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:23,840
The World coordinate system is the only coordinate system

22
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:28,150
that exists within the CG scene we will be drawing.

23
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:31,450
All objects are placed in this world coordinate system

24
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:34,370
to be displayed in a scene.

25
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:38,140
The Local coordinate system is the coordinate system

26
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:43,580
that is mainly used when modeling (designing) each part or object.

27
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:47,230
Even when modeling tilted objects like this, they are usually

28
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:54,180
initially modeled straight and centered on the origin.

29
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,400
The local coordinate system plays an important role,

30
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:00,130
especially when animating multi-linked bodies connected by joints,

31
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:03,740
such as the human body.

32
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:09,590
In the figure, the world coords. of red dot is (3, 1).

33
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:13,280
But after rotating the local system w.r.t. origin,

34
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:19,260
followed by some translation, the world coords. would be (4, 5).

35
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:22,180
Later, we'll study more about

36
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:25,270
converting from local to world coords.

37
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:29,010
Vector has orientation and size (magnitude)

38
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:32,230
For example, the vector from point P1 to P2 can be

39
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:35,680
computed by P2 - P1.

40
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:41,980
Vectors have direction and size, but no fixed positions.

41
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:47,820
So these three vectors in the picture are all the same vector.

42
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:52,400
Whereas scalas are made up of just one component

43
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,420
with no direction, but just magnitude (size).

44
00:02:55,420 --> 00:03:02,560
For example, 3 and 235.5 are scalars.

45
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,150
So let's say you have two vectors V and W.

46
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:10,780
The sum V+W and difference V-W are like this.

47
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:14,620
The sum of two vectors represents a new vector,

48
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:18,820
and you can draw it in these two ways.

49
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:22,800
If you match the tails of

50
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,950
a and b at the same point

51
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:31,620
a - b is a vector from the  head of b to the head of a.

52
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:39,070
You can also draw a - b like this, because a - b is the same as a + (-b)

53
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:46,880
Two vectors a+(-b) and a-b are in different positions,

54
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:49,230
but they have the same direction and magnitude,

55
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:52,310
so they're exactly the same vectors.

56
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:59,740
The magnitude (size) of the vector is sometimes called length, size,

57
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:02,280
and norm, the lengths from the tail to the head,

58
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:08,380
is the square root of the sum of the square of each component.

59
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:11,660
Normalization means make the size of the vector one,

60
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:15,590
keeping the direction of the vector.

61
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:20,340
By dividing each component of the vector by its magnitude

62
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:22,480
we can normalize the vector.

63
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:28,840
Especifically, we call the vector of magnitude 1 "unit vector".

64
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:33,590
The dot product V.W of two vectors V and W

65
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:35,650
is defined like this.

66
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:39,340
It is the sum of the multiples of each component of two vectors.

67
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:43,510
Here, theta is the angle between two vectors.

68
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:46,270
So, if we know the value of dot product,

69
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:51,080
we can get theta using the arc cosine.

70
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:54,050
The result of dot product is a scalar value.

71
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:57,670
So dot product is sometimes called scalar product,

72
00:04:57,670 --> 00:05:01,630
or inner product.

73
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:04,640
Particularly the dot product v.v is

74
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:08,300
the square of the magnitude of the vector, ||v||^2.

75
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:12,890
Let's consider how to find the vector w,

76
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:17,680
which is the projection of v onto u.

77
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,150
First of all, by the definition of cosine, the size of w is

78
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:25,860
the multiplication of the size of v and cosine theta.

79
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:29,870
Also, by the definition of the dot product of u and v,

80
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:35,780
the size of w is (u.v) divided by the size of u.

81
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:38,780
So if u is an unit vector,

82
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:42,460
then w is going to be u.v.

83
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:46,980
The direction of w is the same as u, and we've decided the size of w,

84
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:51,100
w can be represented like this.

85
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:55,310
Now let's look at the relationship between

86
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:58,900
the size of angle theta and dot product.

87
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,120
If dot product is positive,

88
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,710
cosine theta is positive, too.

89
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:07,260
That means theta is somewhere in between 0 and 90 degree.

90
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:10,190
So theta is an acute angle.

91
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:12,280
When dot product is a negative,

92
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:15,040
cosine theta is negative, too.

93
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:21,410
So theta is an obtuse angle larger than 90 degree.

94
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:24,350
If dot product is exactly zero,

95
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:29,600
then two vectors are vertical, that is, theta is 90 degrees.

96
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,840
This relationship comes in

97
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:37,210
very handy for a lot of graphics operations.

98
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:39,580
Assume we have a polygon here.

99
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:44,670
How do we get the normal vector of the polygon?

100
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:48,760
Normal vector N is the cross product of two vectors

101
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:52,880
V1 and V2 on top of that polygon.

102
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,990
Bear in mind, V1, V2 and N form a

103
00:06:56,990 --> 00:07:01,700
right-handed coordinate system.

104
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:04,390
If we try V2 cross V1 rather than V1 cross V2,

105
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:09,710
we can get the normal vector having opposite direction of N.

106
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:14,440
So how do you get the cross product for V1 and V2?

107
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:18,570
The cross product is computed using determinant.

108
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:24,730
We compute 3x3 determinants by using 2x2 determinants.

109
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:31,570
Here, i, j, and k are the unit vector in the x, y and z axes directions.

110
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:36,190
The result of the cross product is vector, not scalar.

111
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:39,730
So cross product is sometimes called vector product,

112
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:43,210
or outer product.

113
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:46,850
We can get the size of the cross product vector with this formula:

114
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:56,680
When A x B = C,  the size of C = (size of A) x (sizeof B) x sin (theta).

115
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:00,780
Here, theta is the angle between vector A and B.

116
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:07,620
So if A and B are unit vector, the size of C is the same as sin(theta).

117
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:10,140
Line means an infinite straight line.

118
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:13,670
We don't have a start point and an end point of a line.

119
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:19,870
A line segment is defined with a start and an end point,

120
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:21,970
and has a finite length.

121
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:28,100
When only a start point, no end point, it is specifically called a ray.

122
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:32,180
The general implicit form of a 2D line is

123
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:38,920
f (x, y) = ax + by + c = 0.

124
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:44,740
The two points form when two points are given are like this:

125
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:47,590
Given two points p1 and p2,

126
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:50,260
the two points parametric form of the line

127
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:54,690
C (t) = (x (t), y (t)).

128
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:57,260
Here, t is a parameter and since it is an infinite line,

129
00:08:57,260 --> 00:09:04,390
the range of t is also from minus infinity to infinity.

130
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:10,270
x(t) is x1 + (x2 - x1)t.

131
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:20,960
Writing this out with respect to x1 and x2 is x1 (1-t) + x2 t.

132
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:24,610
This is the x component of the parametric line C(t).

133
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:30,270
Similarly, y (t) is an expression of y component.

134
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:34,260
That is, C (t) can be seen as a vector form

135
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:37,190
with x(t) and y(t) together.

136
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:42,930
When t is zero, C(0) becomes (x1, y1), or p1.

137
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:49,210
When t is 1, C(1) becomes (x2, y2), or p2.

138
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:54,730
Another form of parametric form is point and vector form.

139
00:09:54,730 --> 00:10:02,330
C (t) = p1 + vt, where p1 is a point on the line

140
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:06,090
and v is the direction vector of the line.

141
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:09,950
The two points form can be rearranged in terms of t.

142
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:12,510
Then, it is the same as the points and vector form.

143
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:14,940
Therefore, even if we use different methods,

144
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:18,700
they represent the same line.

145
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:21,740
We are given an implicit 2D line f.

146
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:24,710
Computing the partial derivative of f with respect to x

147
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:27,080
and the partial derivative with respect to y

148
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:30,220
gives the vector (a, b).

149
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:38,000
This vector is the normal vector N perpendicular to the line.

150
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,840
The tangent vector T = (-b, a),

151
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:47,390
which is the vector perpendicular to the normal vector,

152
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:50,180
is the same as the directional vector of the line.

153
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:54,080
We get it by taking the y component of N, b, as x component in T,

154
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,250
with attaching minus,

155
00:10:55,250 --> 00:11:00,490
and sending a to the y component of T.

156
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:03,520
We can see the normal and tangent vectors are perpendicular

157
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:08,990
by the fact that the dot product N and T is zero.

158
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:12,680
Now consider the line in parametric form C(t).

159
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:16,780
The tangent vector T(t) can be found

160
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:20,640
by differentiating x(t) and y(t) with respect to t, respectively.

161
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:24,680
The normal vector N(t) is perpendicular to T(t),

162
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:28,680
so it can be found just as easily as in the previous case.

163
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:32,180
For line segments where the start and end points are defined,

164
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:35,140
the implicit form is not easy to use.

165
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:38,150
The two points parametric form is the most appropriate.

166
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:42,500
The range of the parameter t in C(t) = (x(t), y(t)) is

167
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:45,500
clearly defined to be between 0 and 1.

168
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:50,870
We can represent x(t) and y(t) as something like an infinite line.

169
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:53,350
By substituting 0 and 1 for t, we can see that

170
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:59,760
the starting point C(0) and the ending point C(1) are obtained.

171
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,220
Let's look at an example.

172
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:04,280
Given two points p1 and p2,

173
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:08,530
we want to find the implicit line that passes through them.

174
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:10,150
We can easily find the implicit line f(x,y) = 0

175
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:15,340
by using two point form formula.

176
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:18,530
The parametric line C(t) is also easy

177
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:20,660
to find from the two points.

178
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:24,870
We also found the tangent and normal vector from C(t).

179
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:30,760
However, if we try to find the normal from the implicit form f(x,y),

180
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:35,560
we get (a, b) = (2, -1),

181
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:40,460
which is the opposite direction from the parametric form.

182
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:43,080
This is an orientation problem in geometry.

183
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,670
This is because we cannot determine

184
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:48,270
the direction the normal of this line is

185
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:50,960
based on the two given points alone.

186
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:55,940
To overcome this problem, we need to include other information,

187
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:59,970
which we will learn more about later.

188
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:04,460
Consider a circle with center at (a, b) and radius r.

189
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:05,950
We have

190
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:14,600
f(x, y) = (x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2 - r^2 = 0,

191
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,650
in implicit form.

192
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:18,300
In parametric form, we have

193
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:21,770
c(theta) = (x(theta), y(theta))

194
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:27,350
= (a + r cos(theta), b + r sin(theta)).

195
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:32,180
Consider the equation of an ellipse

196
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:36,360
whose center is at (h, k) and whose two axes are of lengths a, b.

197
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:39,180
The implicit form looks like this.

198
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:42,500
The parametric form looks like this.

199
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:48,710
Now consider the intersection of a circle and a line.

200
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:51,690
Circle is given in implicit form.

201
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:55,430
Line is given in parametric form.

202
00:13:55,430 --> 00:14:02,820
Substitute x(t) and y(t) into x, y in the implicit equation for circle.

203
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:07,210
This equation is a quadratic equation with respect to t.

204
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:10,300
Let's solve this quadratic equation.

205
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:13,800
If this equation has two roots,

206
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:17,260
then line and circle intersect at two points.

207
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:19,790
By substituting the two t's into C(t),

208
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:22,890
we can get the two points of intersection.

209
00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:26,210
If the equation has only one root,

210
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:30,550
then line is tangent to circle at one point.

211
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:34,000
If the equation hasno roots,

212
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,080
then there is no intersection of line and circle.

213
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,100
In general, in an operation to find the

214
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:42,180
intersection of two objects A and B,

215
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:44,960
we can easily find the intersection

216
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:47,460
by making one implicit

217
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:51,370
and the other parametric.

218
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:53,680
Let's look at an example of finding the

219
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,580
intersection of a circle and a line segment.

220
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:59,990
First, the line segment is given by the two endpoints p1 and p2.

221
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:02,680
The equation of the parametric line through the two points is

222
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:05,820
L(t) = (x(t), y(t)),

223
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:12,420
which is given by x(t) = at + b, y(t) = ct + d.

224
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:16,480
Here, the range of t is limited to between 0 and 1.

225
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:21,510
This is because a line segment is only valid between two endpoints.

226
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:28,050
The equation of the circle is defined

227
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:33,290
in implicit form as (x-e)^2 + (y-f)^2 = r^2 ,

228
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:38,610
where (e,f) are the center and r is the radius of the circle.

229
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:42,530
Now we substitute x(t) and y(t) from the equation of the line

230
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:46,600
into x and y, respectively, of the equation of the circle.

231
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,920
This gives us the quadratic equation

232
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:56,880
At^2 + Bt + C = 0 with respect to t.

233
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,240
To find the roots of the quadratic equation,

234
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:07,090
consider the discriminant D = B^2 - 4AC.

235
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:11,560
For D > 0, there are two roots t.

236
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:16,630
When D = 0, there is one t.

237
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:20,810
When D < 0, there is no real root.

238
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:25,660
However, for the two cases where a real root exists,

239
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:31,940
we still need to verify the root t is between 0 and 1.

240
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:40,530
In this case, the line segment spans the circle, D > 0, has two roots,

241
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:45,380
and both t's are between 0 and 1.

242
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:50,920
This is when D > 0 and two t's are computed,

243
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:55,640
but one root is invalid because the line segment is short,

244
00:16:55,640 --> 00:17:01,300
meaning that one t is not between 0 and 1.

245
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:06,760
This is also the case when D > 0

246
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:10,980
and two t's are found, but neither is between 0 and 1.

247
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:16,140
We can now substitute only valid t into the line equation L(t)

248
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:20,640
to get a valid intersection.

249
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,980
This time, we'll look at lines in 3D.

250
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:29,220
First, we're given two points p1 and p2 in three dimensions.

251
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:31,570
The parametric line C(t) is represented

252
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:34,920
by the components x(t), y(t), and z(t).

253
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:38,940
The representation of x(t), y(t), and z(t) is the same as for a 2D line,

254
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:41,350
and can be found as follows.

255
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:43,950
Substituting 0 and 1 fort, respectively,

256
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:49,830
we see that we get the two points C(0) and C(1).

257
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:53,290
That's the point-vector form of 3D line.

258
00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:59,180
Like 2D, C (t) can be represented as p1 + vt

259
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:02,600
using a point p1 on the line and a direction vector v.

260
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:06,000
When representing a 3D line in an implicit form,

261
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,300
it is not possible to use only one equation.

262
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:13,640
It should be represented by two equations as shown here.

263
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:21,390
The former is about the equation for x and y, the latter about y and z.

264
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:26,560
Now let's look at plane and plane patch.

265
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:30,130
It's important to distinguish between plane and plane patch.

266
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:34,440
A plane is infinite and has no explicit scope.

267
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:38,450
A plane patch is a finite piece of a plane.

268
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:44,040
A plane patch is explicitly given its scope.

269
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:51,020
f(x,y) = Ax + By + Cz + D = 0,

270
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:55,080
which is the plane equation in implicit form.

271
00:18:55,080 --> 00:19:02,800
Here, the vector n = (A, B, C) is the normal vector in the plane.

272
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:06,470
Let's derive the plane equation.

273
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:11,750
First, we are given the normal vector n = (A, B, C).

274
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:18,110
We are also given a point p = (x1, y1, z1) on the plane.

275
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:23,110
In this case, the plane is the set of all points r = (x, y, z)

276
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:29,020
such that the vectors n and (r - p) are perpendicular.

277
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:35,200
Therefore, the dot product of n and (r - p) is zero.

278
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:42,770
Solving and rewriting this expression, we have Ax + By + Cz + D = 0.

279
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:54,990
Here, D = - (A, B, C).(x1, y1, z1) = -n.p.

280
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:57,230
Suppose we are given a point P1

281
00:19:57,230 --> 00:20:05,830
and a plane Ax + By + Cz + D = 0 in three dimensions.

282
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:08,300
Determine whether P1 is on the plane,

283
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:10,560
outside the plane,

284
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:15,430
or inside the plane.

285
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:20,970
Substitute P1's coordinates (x1, y1, z1) into the plane equation

286
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:28,490
to calculate the value of Ax1 + By1 + Cz1 + D.

287
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:32,620
If that value is zero, then P1 is on the plane.

288
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:38,210
If the value is negative, P1 is inside the plane.

289
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:44,690
If the value is positive, P1 is outside the plane.

290
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:51,850
Outside is the direction the plane normal vector is pointing.

291
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:55,480
How can we find the plane

292
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:58,150
that contains all three points p1, p2, and p3?

293
00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:08,490
First, we can find the two vectors (p2 - p1) , (p3 - p1) starting at p1.

294
00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:12,870
Since the normal vector must be perpendicular to both vectors,

295
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:16,490
we can find it as the cross product of the two vectors.

296
00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:21,930
We are remembering that the two vectors (p2 - p1), (p3 - p1),

297
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:24,150
and the normal vector

298
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:29,190
represent a right-handed coordinate system

299
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:32,100
with the x, y, and z directions in turn.

300
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:35,250
Since there is a point above the normal vector and the plane,

301
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:37,300
the implicit equation for the plane

302
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:42,310
can be found as in the slide just a moment ago.

303
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:47,160
This time, let's look at the parametric form of a plane.

304
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:53,010
The plane r can be represented as p + sv + tw.

305
00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:58,280
where s and t are parameters that are infinite intervals.

306
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:02,600
P is an arbitrary point on the plane.

307
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:09,420
V and W are vectors starting at P having different directions.

308
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:13,390
V and W are not necessarily perpendicular,

309
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:15,680
but they must not be parallel to each other.

310
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:23,120
In other words, v and w must be two linearly independent vectors.

311
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:26,730
The implicit form f(x,y,z) of a sphere

312
00:22:26,730 --> 00:22:34,070
with center at (xc, yc, zc) and radius R is

313
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:44,840
(x-xc)^2 + (y-yc)^2 + (z-zc)^2 - R^2 = 0.

314
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:49,570
Let's find the intersection of this sphere with line C(t).

315
00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:53,120
The sphere is implicit and the line is parametric.

316
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:57,020
This is a good way to find the intersection,

317
00:22:57,020 --> 00:23:02,260
as mentioned earlier.

318
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:05,060
We've inserted x, y, and z from line into

319
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:10,630
x(t), y(t), and z(t) from f(x,y,z), respectively.

320
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:15,190
This equation is a quadratic with respect to t.

321
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:20,540
So it has either 0 or 1 or 2 roots.

322
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:23,750
Pictorially, it looks like this.

323
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:29,080
It's very similar to the case of a line-circle intersection.
