00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,550
In this notebook I'm going to walk you through the process of building

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:07,040
and launching an OpenGL program using Xcode on the Mac.

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,770
Xcode is the IDE or Integrated Development Environment

4
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:13,500
provided by MacOS.

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,380
This is a setup course that was done as a test on Xcode version

6
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:20,380
15.2 in early February 2024.

7
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:24,300
If it's Xcode and not this version, then we do need to update it.

8
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,400
We do need to have all these external libraries,

9
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,560
and the easiest way to get them to install is with Homebrew.

10
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:36,540
Homebrew is downloadable from http://brew.sh/installable. So I can do a Homebrew install,

11
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:39,080
and then I can do a BREW command,

12
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:43,280
so I can install GLFW, GLEW, GLM.

13
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,510
After I've done all the installs,

14
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:48,240
if I go into the terminal app and I go into the CD command, /usr/local/Cellar folder,

15
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:52,520
you'll see that I've got GLEW, GLFW, GLM in the install.

16
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:56,040
If you go to /usr/local/include, you'll see that the GL, the GLFW

17
00:00:56,040 --> 00:01:01,690
and the GLM folders are all linked to the appropriate folders that have been installed previously.

18
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:05,440
So glew.h is under /usr/local/include/GL.

19
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:09,220
So we prepare a working folder for projects.

20
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:12,510
So in this example, I've created a folder called MAC.

21
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:15,700
So I'm going to open the source.zip that I downloaded from Runus,

22
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:18,140
and I'm going to do a working folder or laro copy of the utils folder.

23
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:23,450
So what we're going to do is we're going to create a project for Xcode to use OpenGL.

24
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:27,060
So I'm going to do Project template MOS > "Command Line Tool"

25
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:28,910
and I'm going to click next.

26
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:33,090
I'm going to type in the name of Project, and language is going to do C++.

27
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:37,790
And for this, I'm going to do a project name of 00

28
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:39,900
underscore, Working folder (ex.

29
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,590
MAC) and I'm going to click the create button.

30
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:47,450
Under the Working Folder there's a project folder called 00_HellowWindow.

31
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:49,250
I'm going to hit the "Frameworks and Libraries" button under the general tab,

32
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:51,900
and I'm going to search opengl, select the opengl framework, add it.

33
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:57,850
"Frameworks and Libraries" below,

34
00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:00,390
+ button, "Add Other", "Add Files" select.

35
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:03,970
Command – Shift – G and pull up the "go to the folder" dialogue.

36
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:08,590
So we're going to type in the folder that we want to go to,

37
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:12,280
which is /usr/local/Cellar, and we're going to hit enter.

38
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:15,590
under /usr/local/Cellar, you go to the glew folder,

39
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:18,330
you go to the lib folder under the install glew packages,

40
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:24,320
and you select a dylib file.

41
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:30,860
The first thing to note is that we're going to need to select an actual dylib file, not just the virtual file ( link)

42
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:35,720
We'll know whether it's a virtual file or an actual file when we look at the file icon.

43
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:40,160
Similarly we're going to add a dylib file for GLFW.

44
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,810
So we've got three libraries of openGL framework,

45
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:47,330
libGLEW and libglfw in this programming course.

46
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:48,370
So we're going to add in the header search paths /usr/local/include

47
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:53,960
and we're going to add in .utils.

48
00:02:53,960 --> 00:03:00,070
When we create a project, we don't need the default main.cpp, so we delete that.

49
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:04,570
I'm going to copy the 00_HellowWindow project

50
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:06,270
hello_window.cpp from the distributed source to the 00_HelloWindow/00_HelloWindow folder,

51
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:12,280
click right on the 00_HelloWindow project and select from the pop-up menu

52
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:15,840
"Add Files to 00_HelloWindow."

53
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,920
And I'm going to add a copy of hello_window.cpp to my project

54
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:22,560
by clicking the add button.

55
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,910
I'm going to select hello_window.cpp on the navigation area on the left

56
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:29,450
and I'm going to see the source code.

57
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:32,780
I'm going to hit the play button and I'm going to run the program.

58
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:35,300
So I'm going to run it and it's going to pop up a window

59
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:39,330
and it's going to pop up a grey-green background.

60
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:41,780
So I'm going to press ESC key on the keyboard

61
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:44,230
or I'm going to click the end red button

62
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:45,850
and that's going to end the program.

63
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:50,390
The Derived Data folder is the folder for storing the build up run files.

64
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:52,590
It's also the folder that we need to be aware of

65
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:54,910
to be able to store our shader files, our texture files, et cetera,

66
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:56,980
to be able to run our applications.

67
00:03:56,980 --> 00:04:00,230
And to find out where the current Derived Data folder is,

68
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:03,260
I'm going to go to Xcode > Settings menu.

69
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:05,120
If I go to the "Locations" tab,

70
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,540
it's going to take me to the current default "Derived Data" folder.

71
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:16,330
you're usually going to see a default

72
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:18,070
location for "s/user/user name/library/Developer/Xcode/Derivedata."

73
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:21,590
Username is your current user ID.

74
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:25,280
I'm going to turn the Derived Data folder

75
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,190
into a more accessible folder,

76
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:30,720
select the "Custom" option, and then specify the folder that I've chosen.

77
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,850
So under MAC, project directory, I'm going to create a folder called Derived Data,

78
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:37,240
and I'm going to specify that.

79
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:40,900
So I'm going to do build,

80
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:44,050
and you're going to see that

81
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:48,860
the executable, 00_HelloWindow, has come up under MAC/DerivedData/00_HelloWindow... /Build/Products/Debug.

82
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:51,950
So we can put any of the shader files or texture files

83
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:56,130
that we want into a directory such as the executable files.

84
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:59,520
21_Texture1 is our source that contains all of our texture files,

85
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,960
our mage files, our fragment

86
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,920
shader files, all of our fragment shader files.

87
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:12,570
So you can create a project in Xcode and run it in order to get it running.

88
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:14,290
The texture file, container.bmp, and the two shader files,

89
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:18,210
global.fs and global.vs, under the Derivedata folder

90
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:20,810
that you've chosen, 21_Texture1..../Builder/Products/Debug,

91
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:26,610
you need to copy that.

92
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:30,580
But that folder doesn't exist without the first play,

93
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:35,100
the build, so we're going to copy the build before we copy the first three files.

94
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:39,940
So these need to exist under the derived data directory.

95
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:43,350
So just to make it easier for Xcode to edit the shader files,

96
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:48,790
just like we added the CPP files,

97
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:52,170
you can add the FS files from the Derived Data folder into the 21_Texture1 folder.
