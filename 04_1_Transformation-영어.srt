1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,130
Let's start the lecture on Transformations.

2
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:06,770
Frame has a set v that form the axis,

3
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:09,440
and origin P0.

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:16,830
We express the frame as (v1,v2,v3,P0)=(v,P0).

5
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:19,280
Point P is uniquely expressed

6
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:25,790
using a frame as P = P0 + b^T v.

7
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:30,200
Here b = (beta1, beta2, beta3)

8
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:34,970
are the coordinates of point P with respect to frame (v, P0).

9
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:38,080
In the case of point P, because it has a fixed position,

10
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:41,280
it cannot be expressed using only the basis.

11
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:46,050
It can be expressed as a frame with the origin added to the basis.

12
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:48,560
Now let's learn about

13
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:51,860
some basic transformations used in 3D.

14
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:55,410
First, translation (parallel movement).

15
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:59,530
This refers to a case where a point P is translated by d

16
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:02,920
and moved to P'.

17
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:07,250
If all vertices forming one 3D object

18
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:09,800
are translated by d,

19
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:14,580
the object itself will naturally be translated by d.

20
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:19,010
Let’s express the translation in matrix form.

21
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:24,340
Both the original point p and the translated position p' are

22
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:29,330
expressed as 4D vectors that are homogenous coordinates.

23
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:38,290
At this time, the 4 x 4 matrix T(ax,ay,az) is defined like this,

24
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:42,520
where d=(ax,ay,az) is the translation factor.

25
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:46,970
Look closely, the translation factors ax, ay, and az are arranged

26
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:54,540
in order in the rightmost column of the identity matrix.

27
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:57,000
By calculating Tp

28
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,570
by multiplying this translation matrix T

29
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:03,890
by the original point p, we get p'.

30
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:07,540
This fits the definition of translation well.

31
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:10,640
In the future, we will often see translation

32
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:12,970
operation and translation matrix T

33
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:17,670
being used interchangeably.

34
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:24,130
Then, consider the case of translating once as d=(ax,ay,az)

35
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:35,060
and then translating as -d=(-ax,-ay,-az) back again.

36
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:40,550
Point p is translated by d and goes to p',

37
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:46,130
and then translated by -d and returns to p.

38
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:54,850
Since p' = Tp, if both sides are multiplied

39
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:56,010
by the inverse matrix of T, T^(-1), p = T^(-1)p'.

40
00:02:56,010 --> 00:03:03,290
In other words, the inverse translation matrix is

41
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:07,530
the inverse matrix of the original translation matrix T.

42
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:10,560
Then, what is the  translation matrix

43
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,230
with the translation factor -d,

44
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:17,690
representing the inverse translation of the original translation?

45
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:22,080
This is the same as the inverse matrix of T, T^(-1),

46
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,580
and if you solve for it, you get the formula:

47
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:31,690
This is exactly the case when -d = (-ax,-ay,-az)

48
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:35,620
which was created by creating the translation

49
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:39,940
matrix we defined.

50
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:42,580
This time we will define rotation,

51
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:45,670
but to simplify the explanation,

52
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:48,080
we will first look at the case of 2D rotation.

53
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,180
Let's call the point

54
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:53,990
that appears when the 2D point (x, y) is rotated

55
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:56,660
counterclockwise by theta as (x',y').

56
00:03:56,660 --> 00:04:00,290
At this time, the original x can be expressed as rho

57
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:03,710
cos(phi) and y can be expressed as rho sin(phi).

58
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:07,700
Here rho is the distance from the origin to (x,y),

59
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:09,260
which, as we well know,

60
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:14,160
is the square root of (x^2 + y^2).

61
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:19,340
The results x' and y' after rotating by theta

62
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:24,260
can be expressed as rho cos(theta+phi)

63
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:26,030
and rho sin(theta + phi), respectively.

64
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:30,020
Using the sine and cosine formulas,

65
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:33,130
x' and y' can each be expressed like this.

66
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:36,840
Here, if you replace rho cos(phi) and rho sin(phi) with x and y,

67
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:40,950
you get an equation like this.

68
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:45,760
This will be the formula to find the result

69
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,830
(x',y') when (x,y) is rotated by theta.

70
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:51,150
Finally, if we organize this equation in matrix form,

71
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:52,560
it looks like this.

72
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,850
Here, the 2 x 2 matrix made up of cosine and sine

73
00:04:56,850 --> 00:05:00,140
becomes the matrix of 2D rotation.

74
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:01,580
Now we want to see the 3D case.

75
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:04,240
and define rotation in 3D.

76
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,810
For rotations in 2D, the axis of rotation was always (0,0,1),

77
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:10,230
i.e. the z-axis.

78
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:12,060
However, in 3D an infinite number of rotation

79
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:14,220
axes are possible.

80
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:16,870
First, if you define 3D rotation

81
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:19,070
with respect to the z-axis

82
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:20,980
used in 2D, it becomes this equation.

83
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:25,950
If we rotate (x,y,z) about the z-axis

84
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:29,870
by theta, x' and y' remain the same as when rotated in 2D,

85
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:33,040
and z' remains the same as z.

86
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,290
Because the z-axis is the axis of rotation,

87
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:38,280
if you rotate any point about the z-axis,

88
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:42,650
the z-coordinate does not change

89
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:45,680
because the rotation occurs in the xy-plane,

90
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,910
which is perpendicular to the z-axis.

91
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:51,540
Using a matrix, this can be expressed as p' = Rz p.

92
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:53,550
Here, Rz(theta) is

93
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:56,880
a 4 x 4 rotation matrix that represents

94
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,610
rotation by theta about the z axis.

95
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:04,110
If you look closely, the 2 x 2 part in the top left of Rz(theta)

96
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:08,820
is the same as the 2D rotation matrix we saw in the previous slide.

97
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:11,950
The remaining part is in the form of a general transformation matrix

98
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:15,680
where only the diagonal elements are 1.

99
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,570
Then, why is the rotation matrix in 3D

100
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:23,710
expressed as a 4 x 4 matrix instead of 3 x 3?

101
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:27,680
This is because of the translation matrix explained earlier.

102
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,930
As we saw earlier, the translation

103
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:34,390
matrix cannot be expressed as a 3 x 3

104
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:37,930
matrix, and homogenous coordinates must be used.

105
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:41,800
From the perspective of data structure,

106
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,300
if all transformation matrices should be expressed as one type,

107
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:49,940
This is why we use a 4 x 4 matrix rather than a 3 x 3 matrix.

108
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:53,770
Now let's look at the rotation about the x and y axes.

109
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:59,130
First, the rotation matrix Rx(theta) about the x-axis is expressed like this.

110
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:02,750
If you look closely, the 2 x 2 rotation part is centered in

111
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:05,080
the center of the matrix.

112
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:09,800
Similarly, the rotation matrix about the y axis looks like this.

113
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,430
Let's say we obtain (x',y') by applying rotation transformation

114
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:17,920
R(theta), which rotates by theta, to (x,y).

115
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:21,710
Now let's look at the reverse transformation R^(-1)(theta),

116
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:26,670
which returns from (x',y') back to (x,y).

117
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:32,020
Conceptually, R^(-1) is the same as R(-theta).

118
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:37,290
In other words, after rotating by theta,

119
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:40,240
the rotation back to the original position is rotated by -theta.

120
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,500
We used cos(theta) and sin(theta)

121
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:46,610
values for rotations about the x, y, and z axes.

122
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:50,550
If you replace -theta with theta in this equation,

123
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:53,850
cos(-theta) is the same as cos(theta), and

124
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:57,800
sin(-theta) is the same as -sin(theta).

125
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,660
So, the matrix of

126
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:04,890
R(-theta) can be easily obtained by slightly changing R(theta).

127
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:10,120
In other words, R^(-1) is the inverse matrix of R.

128
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:16,790
However, if you actually calculate R^(-1), it comes out the same as R^T.

129
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:20,070
Transpose of a matrix refers to an operation that changes the rows

130
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:22,510
and columns of a matrix.

131
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:26,610
In summary, when R is given,

132
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:31,780
R^(-1),R(-theta), and R^T are all equal.

133
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:34,180
Rotation and translation during transformation

134
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,780
are called

135
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:39,010
rigid transformation or rigid-body transformation.

136
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:42,690
This means that rotation and translation do not change

137
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:45,270
the shape or size of the object being transformed,

138
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:50,590
regardless of how many times it is repeated and in what order.

139
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:53,870
Looking at the picture, reflection transformation

140
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:56,400
also belongs to rigid transformation.

141
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:59,380
Reflection is a transformation that reflects an object

142
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:03,730
as if it were reflected in a mirror around a certain reference axis.

143
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:05,320
Rigid transformation simply changes the location

144
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:10,100
and orientation of the object.

145
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:15,400
On the other hand, in the case of non-rigid transformation,

146
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:20,460
the size and the shape of the object can be changed, such as by distorting it.

147
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:25,070
Scaling is a transformation that changes the size of an object.

148
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:27,010
Uniform scaling, which changes the size of an object consistently along all axes,

149
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:30,100
is also possible, and non-uniform scaling,

150
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:33,200
which changes the size to an inconsistent size

151
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,210
along the axis directions, is also possible.

152
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:41,600
Scaling is a type of non-rigid transformation.

153
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,030
Scaling can be thought of

154
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:47,710
as changing the distance from the origin to point (x,y,z).

155
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:53,210
The formula for changing the distance to x by beta_x times,

156
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:57,680
the distance to y by beta_y times, and the distance to z by beta_z times is as follows.

157
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:02,970
Here (beta_x, beta_y, beta_z) is called the scaling factor.

158
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:09,810
For example, if beta_x is set to 0.5, the distance in the x direction will be half the original distance.

159
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:12,470
If beta_x, beta_y, and beta_z are all the same value,

160
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:15,790
uniform scaling occurs.

161
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:18,850
Otherwise, non-uniform scaling occurs.

162
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:24,730
When expressing scaling transformation like p' = Sp,

163
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:29,400
matrix S is a 4x4 scaling

164
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:34,830
matrix, and beta_x, beta_y, and beta_z are located in the diagonal elements.

165
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:39,220
Assume that (x, y) is scaled by (beta_x, beta_y, beta_z)

166
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:41,490
and sent to (x', y').

167
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:47,050
At this time, inverse scaling S^(-1), which returns (x', y') back to (x, y),

168
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:53,330
takes S(1/beta_x, 1/beta_y, 1/beta_z), that is,

169
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:56,550
the reciprocal of the scaling factor. It's possible.

170
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:57,950
Even without detailed explanation, you can intuitively understand why.

171
00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:01,340
Shearing transformation serves to tilt

172
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:03,180
and distort the original object

173
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:07,110
as shown in the picture.

174
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:11,770
To see this in more detail, let's look at a cross section in the xy plane.

175
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:16,430
In the picture, we are translating the point (x,y) to (x',y').

176
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:19,680
As the y value increases, the amount of movement increases,

177
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,690
which ultimately has the effect of tilting and distorting the object

178
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:25,770
by the angle of theta.

179
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:30,900
At the base of the square,

180
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:34,590
you can see that the original base remains the same because y = 0.

181
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:41,430
If this is expressed as a trigonometric function,

182
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:47,540
tangent theta can be expressed as y'/(x'-x) or y/(x'-x) by definition.

183
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:52,800
cotangent theta is the reciprocal of tangent theta,

184
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,320
so it is (x'-x)/y.

185
00:11:54,320 --> 00:12:02,680
From this, x' = x + y

186
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:07,140
cot(theta), y'= y, and since it only moves in the x direction, z' doesn't change.

187
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:11,170
If this is expressed as an x-shearing matrix Hx(theta),

188
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:12,610
it becomes this equation.

189
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:18,880
And, Hx^(-1)(theta), which is the inverse of Hx(theta),

190
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,910
is the same as Hx(-theta).

191
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:23,740
The y-shearing and z-shearing

192
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:27,860
transformations can be easily derived

193
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:30,000
using methods similar to this derivation process.

194
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,490
I encourage you to try these yourself.

195
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:37,520
Let us assume that P is transformed into P' by M1,

196
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:42,790
and P' is transformed into P'' by M2.

197
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:49,550
These two equations can be combined to write P'' = M2 M1 P.

198
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:53,650
If the product of M2 M1 is called M3

199
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:57,010
matrix, P'' can be expressed as M3 P.

200
00:12:57,010 --> 00:13:01,630
At this time, M3 is called the matrix of composite transformation.

201
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:04,770
One thing to note

202
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:07,030
is that composite transformation does not follow commutative laws.

203
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:13,740
In other words, M2 M1 and M1 M2 do not represent the same transformation.

204
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:18,130
This is also a general property of matrix multiplication.

205
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:22,850
For example, in this picture, P is first rotated by 90 degrees

206
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:27,380
and transformed into P', then translated again by (3,3),

207
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:31,490
and finally, P'' = (2, 6).

208
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:36,180
However, if you do translation (3,3) first and then rotate 90 degrees,

209
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:42,690
you will get a completely different result, P''=(-4,6).

210
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:49,170
In other words, when considering composite transformation, you must pay attention to the order of transformations.

211
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:54,060
For an explanation of matrix multiplication, please see this URL.

212
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:58,010
Let’s learn more about the properties of the rotation matrix.

213
00:13:58,010 --> 00:14:03,270
The 4x4 rotation matrix R in 3D is defined like this.

214
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:08,080
We only considered rotation about the basic axes x, y, and z, but in fact

215
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:12,860
there are infinitely many vectors that can be rotation axes in 3D.

216
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:17,650
Considering these general rotation axes,

217
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:19,600
the general form of the rotation matrix is expressed as this equation.

218
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:26,830
In particular, rotation uses only the 3x3 portion in the upper left of the 4x4 matrix.

219
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:33,310
So, let’s consider only this 3x3 part by separating it into an R-hat matrix.

220
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:36,780
R-hat has the following properties.

221
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:40,730
First, all row vectors are perpendicular to each other.

222
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:45,340
All column vectors are also perpendicular to each other.

223
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:49,460
And, if you multiply R-hat and the transpose of R-hat,

224
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:52,020
you get the identity matrix.

225
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:55,420
As a result, you can see that

226
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:58,920
the transpose of R-hat is the same as the inverse of R-hat.

227
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:03,420
In general, finding an inverse matrix is quite complicated,

228
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:08,700
but it can be done simply by transposing, which is very convenient.

229
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:12,400
A matrix that satisfies the three properties

230
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:15,180
up to this point is called an “orthogonal matrix.”

231
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:19,810
As mentioned earlier, R-hat has one more property.

232
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:23,220
The property is that all row vectors and column

233
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:25,920
vectors are unit vectors.

234
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:29,550
A matrix that satisfies all four properties

235
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:32,100
is called an “orthonormal matrix” and is a correct rotation

236
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:37,550
matrix that maintains the properties of rigid transformation.

237
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:41,560
The 4x4 rotation matrix R looks like this.

238
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:44,880
Translation matrix T has this form.

239
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:48,370
Now let's consider a composite transformation that performs rotation

240
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:51,300
first and then translation.

241
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:57,210
The matrix M of this composite transformation is the product of T and R.

242
00:15:57,210 --> 00:16:01,130
If rotation is applied to point p first,

243
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:05,280
it becomes Rp, and if translation is applied to Rp, it becomes TRp, so M = TR.

244
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:08,530
We have already explained previously

245
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:13,780
that the order of matrix multiplication should not be changed.

246
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:18,190
If you look closely at the calculated M,

247
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:20,530
the rotation matrix is still there in the 3x3 part at the top left,

248
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:22,730
On the other hand, you can see that

249
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:26,370
the translation factors remain the same in the rightmost column.

250
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:31,280
If you actually do this matrix multiplication TR, you will get something like this.

251
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:34,710
So, you can see that

252
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:37,510
the matrix of the composite transformation of “translation

253
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:40,680
after rotation” can be easily found

254
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:43,890
without actually calculating the product of the matrices.

255
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:46,510
As an example of a composite transformation,

256
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:50,980
let's consider rotation about an arbitrary point other than the origin.

257
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:56,580
In the picture, the gray triangle has been transformed into a yellow triangle

258
00:16:56,580 --> 00:17:01,810
by rotating 90 degrees about the red point P = (x1, y1).

259
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:07,090
The rotations we have considered so far have all been rotations about the origin.

260
00:17:07,090 --> 00:17:13,810
To use that rotation, we first apply T1(-x1, -y1) to the triangle,

261
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:18,610
which translates P to the origin.

262
00:17:18,610 --> 00:17:22,960
Then we apply rotation R(theta) about the origin.

263
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:27,600
Finally, apply T2(x1, y1)

264
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:30,260
which translates the origin back to the original P.

265
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:33,070
The composite transformation that combines all three stages of transformation

266
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:38,630
is T2 R T1.

267
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:42,700
Let's consider two different frames

268
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:47,440
(v1, v2, v3, P0) and (u1, u2, u3, Q0).

269
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:53,230
The first frame is a frame with P0

270
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:56,350
as the origin and (v1, v2, v3) as the three axes, that is, basis vectors.

271
00:17:56,350 --> 00:18:00,750
Likewise, the second frame is a frame with Q0 as the origin and (u1, u2,

272
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:05,390
u3) as the basis vector.

273
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:09,710
Among them, if frame (u1,

274
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:15,090
u2, u3, Q0) is expressed in relation to another frame

275
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:17,300
(v1, v2, v3, P0), it can be expressed as this equation.

276
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:20,430
In other words, the u1, u2,

277
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:26,930
u3 vectors can each be expressed as coordinates on the basis

278
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:32,250
(v1, v2, v3), and since Q0 is a point,

279
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:35,050
it can be expressed like this regarding the frame (v1, v2, v3, P0).

280
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:38,830
These equations are organized in matrix form.

281
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:43,480
That is, (u1, u2, u3, Q0)

282
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:48,180
can be expressed as the product of M and (v1, v2, v3, P0).

283
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:54,260
Here, M is a 4 x 4 matrix that contains the coordinates of (v1, v2, v3, P0)

284
00:18:54,260 --> 00:19:00,090
of u1, u2, u3, and Q0.

285
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:05,470
Matrix M is called “matrix of change of frames”.

286
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:10,860
In other words, it is a matrix that changes the first frame to the second frame.

287
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:16,090
Let us assume that the coordinates of point P in frames G and F

288
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:18,940
are a and b, respectively.

289
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:22,110
If you recall from the beginning of this note

290
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:25,460
where we expressed the coordinates of a point in a given frame, p can first be written

291
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:33,460
as b^T times F with respect to the F frame.

292
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:40,500
Likewise, if we express p in terms of the G frame, we get a^T times G.

293
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:47,960
If there is a transformation M that changes b^T to a^T, then

294
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:55,470
b^T times M will be equal to a^T, so it can be expressed like this.

295
00:19:55,470 --> 00:20:00,700
To rewrite it, a^T = b^T M.

296
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:05,040
If you transpose both sides, it becomes like this:

297
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:09,950
If you solve this, it becomes a = M^T b.

298
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:14,060
For reference, the transpose of XY

299
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:19,050
multiplied by two matrices is the transpose of Y multiplied by the transpose of X.

300
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:23,530
Here, M^T can be seen as a transformation

301
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:25,420
matrix that converts coordinates from frame

302
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:28,080
F to G.

303
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:31,960
Here, to convert the coordinates in the opposite direction,

304
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,900
that is, from frame G to F,

305
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:37,790
you can apply the inverse of M^T.

306
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:43,520
Here, let's denote the inverse of M^T as matrix T.

307
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:47,680
When I try to explain it this way, I don’t really get the hang of it.

308
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,970
Let's look at a real example.

309
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:54,930
First, consider two different frames G and F.

310
00:20:54,930 --> 00:21:01,200
Let's call the coordinates of a point in those two frames a and b, respectively.

311
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,340
Since we said that a = Cb, C is the coordinates conversion

312
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:09,780
matrix that goes from b (i.e.

313
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:13,030
in frame F) to a (i.e. in frame G).

314
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:17,580
In the previous slide, C was expressed as M^T.

315
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:21,420
The problem is how to find this C.

316
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:24,420
As shown in the figure,

317
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:27,570
let's assume that we can represent frame G in frame F.

318
00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:32,840
In the picture, the x-axis of G is represented by a unit vector u in F, and the

319
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:37,910
y-axis is represented by a unit vector v in F.

320
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:42,270
Also, let's assume that the origin of the G frame becomes point

321
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:44,270
p when expressed in terms of the F frame.

322
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:48,540
At this time, let's consider C's inverse first.

323
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:52,590
This is a matrix that converts the coordinates of G to F.

324
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:57,880
In the previous slide, the inverse of C was indicated as T.

325
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:02,410
Since T is a matrix that converts G to F, if

326
00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:08,040
the x-axis of G (1, 0, 0) is converted to T, u comes out.

327
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:13,380
Recall that in the previous slide we assumed that

328
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:16,580
the x-axis of G is expressed as u in the F frame.

329
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:24,190
Here, the x-axis of G is indicated as (1, 0, 0, 0) in homogenous expression.

330
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:30,380
In fact, the part of T that is contributed by the transformation results of the x, y, and z axes of G is the 3 x 3 part in the upper left corner,

331
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:37,330
which is the rotation part of the 4 x 4 matrix.

332
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:41,170
Therefore, we set the w value to 0.

333
00:22:41,170 --> 00:22:47,000
Likewise, if you transform the y-axis of G (0, 1,

334
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
0) to T, you will get v.

335
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:56,330
Also, if you convert the z-axis of G (0, 0, 1) to T, you will get n.

336
00:22:56,330 --> 00:23:02,340
Finally, if we convert (0, 0, 0), the origin of G, to T, we get p.

337
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:08,780
Here, the origin and p are both points, not axes, so set w = 1.

338
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:14,210
Now, if we collect all these results and get the T matrix, it looks like this.

339
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:17,130
Looking at the T matrix, the u, v, and n vectors

340
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:21,810
are written in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd columns, respectively,

341
00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:25,140
and the coordinates of the origin p are placed in the last column.

342
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:27,760
However, this form is something we see a lot.

343
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,960
It is a form of composite transformation

344
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:35,200
matrix of “translation after rotation”.

345
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:42,320
That is, when the unit vectors of the three basic axes of G in the F frame are u, v, and n,

346
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:48,340
Create a 3x3 rotation matrix with three columns of the three vectors and place them in

347
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:53,690
the upper left 3x3 part of F.

348
00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:57,740
And just make the coordinates of the origin of G in the F frame

349
00:23:57,740 --> 00:24:00,970
the translation part of T.

350
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:04,590
In other words, the T matrix that converts G to F is the product of the translation

351
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:10,210
matrix and rotation matrix created as above.

352
00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:16,880
In summary, if any frame G can be expressed in terms of a reference frame F,

353
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:23,250
we can easily create a T matrix

354
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:26,440
that converts the coordinates of G to the coordinates of F like this.

355
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,880
So, in the opposite case, that is,

356
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:33,920
how do we find matrix C that converts F to G?

357
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:38,520
C can be found by calculating the inverse of T.

358
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:44,840
However, it is said that T is the product of the translation matrix and rotation matrix.

359
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:51,780
Here, let's express the translation matrix as H and the rotation matrix as K.

360
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:54,740
Then C, which is the inverse of T, becomes the product of the inverse of K

361
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:58,780
and the inverse of H.

362
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:02,260
As we said earlier that the rotation matrix is orthonormal

363
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:06,130
and its inverse is the same as transpose,

364
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:11,660
the inverse of K can be obtained by simply transposing K.

365
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:15,480
Also, the inverse of translation matrix H can be easily obtained

366
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:20,270
because it represents translation in the opposite direction of the translation

367
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:24,280
factor (p_1, p_2, p_3).

368
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:29,150
In other words, to find C, it is much simpler to inverse

369
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:35,790
H and K separately before multiplying HK to calculate T.

370
00:25:35,790 --> 00:25:38,870
Now that we know how

371
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:40,770
to obtain the matrix of change of frame in both directions,

372
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:43,500
let's solve the actual problem.

373
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:47,350
To simplify the calculation, we will describe it as a two-dimensional problem.

374
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:51,790
First, the unit vector u representing the x-axis of G in the F frame

375
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:55,950
is (2 / root(5), 1 / root(5)).

376
00:25:55,950 --> 00:26:01,160
Also, the unit vector v representing the y-axis of G in the F frame

377
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:05,390
is (-1 / root(5), 2 / root(5)).

378
00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:10,380
In fact, you can see that these numbers are correct

379
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:14,080
if you calculate them by counting the graduations of the 2D grid in the picture.

380
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:20,640
Also, if the origin of G is expressed in the F frame, p = (3, 2).

381
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:25,550
Now we want to find matrix T that converts G to F.

382
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:31,250
As seen in the previous slide, T is the product of the translation

383
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:35,370
matrix created using p and the rotation matrix created using u and v.

384
00:26:35,370 --> 00:26:38,900
That is, T is expressed in this way.

385
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:44,270
Now, in the opposite direction, that is, matrix C,

386
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:48,400
which converts F to G, just needs to find the inverse of T.

387
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:56,890
By using T = Tp R, I think I can find the inverse more easily.

388
00:26:56,890 --> 00:27:03,980
(Tp R)^(-1) is R^(-1) Tp^(-1).

389
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:07,080
This can be expressed as an equation:

390
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:10,230
Finally, multiplying the two inverse matrices

391
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:13,040
gives us the C matrix.

392
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:18,060
Now, to convert the point q = (4,

393
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:21,500
5) expressed in terms of F frame to coordinates in terms of G frame,

394
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:24,400
we just need to calculate the product of C and q.

395
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:29,680
When I calculated it, I got (2.236, 2.236).

396
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:34,580
Looking at the G frame in the picture as a standard, it seems to be roughly correct.
