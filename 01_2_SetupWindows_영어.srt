1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,210
In this notebook we're going to talk about the setup for coding

2
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:07,530
OpenGL in PC Windows.

3
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:09,710
First of all, update

4
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:12,560
your PC drivers with your latest stuff.

5
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:14,340
It's not necessarily required,

6
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:18,590
but it's best to do it for the best possible outcome.

7
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:21,290
We're going to go to the Visual Studio page

8
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:26,140
and download the community version of the Visual Studio 2022.

9
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:32,320
Set "Desktop development with C++" as a workload.

10
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,830
Before you create a project in Visual Studio,

11
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:38,770
you better open "tools > projects and solutions > locations,"

12
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:41,330
and start setting up new project locations.

13
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:43,440
In this example, we're going to create a new project under a new folder,

14
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,970
so we set a new location for the project.

15
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:52,430
We're going to download all the external libraries.

16
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:59,870
At first, we download GLEW, GLFW, and the glm files.

17
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:05,670
Then uncompress glew-xxx.zip with the option of "uncompress here."

18
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:10,100
And rename this folder glew-xxx-win32 to GLEW.

19
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:16,220
Then, create a folder called "External Libs" at the same level as "projects" folder.

20
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:21,380
And, put the GLEW folder inside of External Libs.

21
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:25,080
The current folder structure is shown in the figure.

22
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:29,920
Under the projects folder our projects go into each of different sub folders.

23
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:35,760
Then, uncompress glfw-xxx.zip as the option: "uncompress here".

24
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:41,760
Then rename the GLFW-xx.WIN64 folder to GLFW.

25
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:46,460
And put the GLFW folder under External Libs.

26
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:49,950
After that, you can see the following folder hierarchy.

27
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:54,100
Uncompress GLM-xxx.zip with the option of "here."

28
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:57,830
Rename the glm folder to GLM.

29
00:01:57,830 --> 00:02:01,660
Under GLM,  delete all except the glm folder.

30
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:06,620
Move the GLM folder and put it under the External Libs folder.

31
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:11,600
After installing GLM, the folder structure should look like this.

32
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:17,680
Start to edit the file: External Libs > GLM > glm > glm.hpp

33
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,400
and you add a line with a picture.

34
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,440
If you don't do that, you should add this line to every source file

35
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,980
before you include the glm.hpp,

36
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:31,870
and we don't want to do that, so do it now.

37
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:34,960
Now downloaded the example source files from LearnUs,

38
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:41,260
then, copy the "utils" folder to the same level as External Libs and projects.

39
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:44,810
So now the folder structure should be like this.

40
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:49,140
Now, let's  create a new project in Visual Studio.

41
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:53,480
Select Console App, C++, and then click "Next".

42
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:57,830
Select and fill the Project name, Location name, and Solution name,

43
00:02:57,830 --> 00:02:59,770
and click the Create button.

44
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:03,010
In our example, Project and Solution names

45
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:05,790
are set to "00_HelloWindow".

46
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:08,860
Location is defined as the projects folder that we created earlier.

47
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:14,080
Among the source codes, find "hello_window.cpp" in 00_HelloWindow folder,

48
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:21,780
and copy the file into the source code folder in the project that we just created.

49
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:27,570
the source code folder is  00_HelloWindow / 00_HelloWindow.

50
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:34,220
If you have a shader files (.vs, .fs) and any texture image files,

51
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:37,180
you better copy them into the same source folder.

52
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:40,840
We'll see that in a later source project.

53
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:46,010
We'll add the hello_window.cpp that we just copied into our project.

54
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:49,430
In the solution explorer you'll find a menu by clicking the right mouse button click.

55
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:53,770
and select "source file" and click on "add existing files",

56
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:58,190
then you'll be able to add hello_window.cpp into the project.

57
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:05,020
By right mouse button clicking on your project name in the Solution

58
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:08,530
Select "Property" at the bottom of the pop-up menu.

59
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:12,720
Select C/C+ > general > additional directory

60
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,360
and then you can add four include directories.

61
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,840
Here $(SolutionDir) represents

62
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:22,420
the folder of the current project,

63
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:26,960
which is common for all of other projects to represent each of the project folders.

64
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,860
On a property > linker > general > additional library directory,

65
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:31,770
Add two directories.

66
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:36,460
And add the follwing three libraries at linker > input > additional dependencies,

67
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:43,520
opengl32.lib, glew32.lib, glfw3.lib

68
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:50,120
Copy the glew32.dll in External Libs > GLEW > bin > Release > Win32

69
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:55,930
into the source folder of project.

70
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:59,870
Finally, pressing "Control F5" allows you to build the application and run it.
